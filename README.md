# Automatic-MLA-Formatter

This is an automatic MLA formatter built in Python 3.12.1.

Basically, it will ask for basic information about the document/item you are citing, and it will automatically format it for you in MLA style.


GETTING STARTED



Basically, you're going to have to install two things to get this to work:

1) Python 
2) Download the files from this repository


First Step:

Install Python. It's simple. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and just download it. It's so simple a tree could do it.

When you install it, be sure to select "Install for all users":

Second Step:

Download the main.py file from this repository.




Now that you've gotten everything installed, move the main.py file to your desktop. Right click on it, and select “Open With” and then select “Python.” The program should then open up and be usable!
