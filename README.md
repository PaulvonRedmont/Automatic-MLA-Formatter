# Automatic-MLA-Formatter Version 1.1

This is an automatic MLA formatter built in Python 3.12.1. 

Why use this? Doesn't easybib exist?

Yea, it does, but it's stuffed with ads and probably malware if you click on 'em. 

This 1) doesn't have ads and 2) works offline, so if you're on a plane or something and don't have internet access for easybib to save you, you'll thank me then.

It will ask for basic information about the document/item you are citing, and it will automatically format it for you in MLA style.


GETTING STARTED



Basically, you're going to have to install two things to get this to work:

1) Python 
2) Download the files from this repository
3) Install additional libraries with pip (this allows the program to function properly)


First Step:

Install Python. It's simple. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and just download it. It's so simple a tree could do it.

IMPORTANT: WHEN INSTALLING, YOU MUST SELECT "Install for all users":

Second Step:

Download the main.py file from this repository.



Third Step:

Navigate to your command prompt, and type in `python --version` and hit enter. It should show you the python version that you currently have.

Next, type in  `pip install pyperclip` and hit enter. It'll take a few seconds to complete the install.

Once it is done installing, you can exit the command prompt.


Now that you've gotten everything installed, move the main.py file to your desktop. Right-click on it, select “Open With” and then select “Python.” The program should then open up and be usable!
